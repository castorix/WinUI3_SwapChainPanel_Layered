# WinUI3_SwapChainPanel_Layered

Test transparency with layered windows by using a SwapChainPanel, which was broken since Windows app SDK 1.1.0 (with black/white background in DirectComposition window)

Only tested on Windows 10 (22H2)

From https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/1247, does not work fine on Windows 11 atm (unwanted border + shadow)...
